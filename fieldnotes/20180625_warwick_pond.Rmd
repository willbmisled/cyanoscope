## Field Notes
* Who: Stephen Shivers and Bryan
* Where: Warwick Pond (site 2)
* When: June 25, 2018
* How:  3 m vertical tow with a 50 `r paste0(expression("\U03BC"), "m")` plankton net.  Sample stored cold overnight then viewed with a inverted microscope.
* General Comments:  Beautiful day on the lake.  Light breeze, partly cloudy, the water was greenish but did not appear to be blooming.  Using the algae torch we saw elevate chlorophyll a (28-38 `r paste0(expression("\U03BC"), "g / l")`) but low phycocyanin (2-3 `r paste0(expression("\U03BC"), "g / l")`).
* Qualitative phytoplankton assessment - relative abundance assessed visually on a 1 - 5 scale with 1 being low abundance (rare).  We found the following taxa:
