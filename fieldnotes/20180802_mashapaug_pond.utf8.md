## Field Notes
* Who: Stephen Shivers and Bryan
* Where: Warwick Pond 
* When: August 2, 2018
* How:  3 m vertical tow with a 50 μm plankton net.  Sample stored cold overnight then viewed with a inverted microscope.
* General Comments:  The lake has a nasty bloom.  Hot and muggy day.  The algae torch indicated a total chlorophyll around 50 μg / l of which almost all was attributed to cyanobacteria.
* Qualitative phytoplankton assessment - relative abundance assessed visually on a 1 - 5 scale with 1 being low abundance (rare).  We found the following taxa:
